## üöÄ Strategy Builder Development Roadmap

### Executive Summary

**Project Goal**: Build a production-ready trading system focusing on 5 core indicators with comprehensive visualization and backtesting capabilities, tested continuously with custom datasets throughout development.

**Core Indicators**:
1. **Liquidity Grab Detection** - Identifies liquidity sweeps for entry setups
2. **Change of Character (CHoCH)** - Detects trend direction changes
3. **Break of Structure (BOS)** - Validates structural market breaks
4. **Fair Value Gap (FVG)** - Locates precise entry zones
5. **Order Block Detection** - Identifies institutional trading levels

**Data Format**: Custom datasets in standard OHLCV format (datetime, open, high, low, close, volume)

**Testing Philosophy**: Universal testing across multiple timeframe combinations and market conditions without hardcoding specific scenarios. Continuous validation throughout development.

**Visualization Requirements**: Individual validation plots for each indicator during development, plus comprehensive backtesting visualization showing only used indicators with all executed trades.

## üìä Visualization Requirements

### Individual Indicator Validation Plots
Each of the 5 core indicators requires its own validation plot during development:
- **Purpose**: Verify correct indicator behavior and signal generation
- **Content**: Price chart with indicator signals clearly marked
- **Testing**: Visual confirmation that indicators detect intended patterns
- **Format**: Clear, labeled plots showing indicator activation points

### Comprehensive Backtesting Visualization
The backtesting system produces a master plot containing:
- **Price Chart**: Displayed on the lowest timeframe used in the strategy
- **Indicators**: Only the indicators actually used in the specific strategy
- **Trade Markers**: All executed trades with clear entry/exit points
- **Trade Logic**: Visual connection between indicator signals and trade decisions
- **Layout**: Organized display with price as main chart, indicators as overlays or subplots

### Backtesting Statistics
- Comprehensive framework for calculating backtesting statistics
- Specific metrics to be determined based on requirements
- Flexible architecture to add new metrics as needed
- Clear presentation of strategy performance

## üìÅ Data Requirements

### Custom Dataset Format
- **Structure**: datetime, open, high, low, close, volume
- **Source**: Pre-existing custom datasets (no additional data handling needed)
- **Integration**: Direct loading into backtesting system
- **Testing**: All development and testing uses these custom datasets

## üìù Development Guidelines

### File Execution Rules
- **ALWAYS use absolute paths when running Python files**: `/home/lordargus/Tradient/strategy_builder/run_tests.py`
- **Never assume current working directory**: Always verify with `pwd` first
- **The working directory is**: `/home/lordargus/Tradient/strategy_builder`

### Testing Requirements
- **Every class and function MUST have corresponding tests** in the `tests/` directory
- Maintain high test coverage for reliability
- **Run tests using**: `python3 /home/lordargus/Tradient/strategy_builder/run_tests.py`

### Code Development Process
1. **Before writing code to a new file**:
   - First write and explain the code in the CLI`
   - Demonstrate functionality with examples
   - Validate the approach before file creation
2. **Single file development**:
   - Create and complete ONE file at a time
   - Ensure each file is fully tested before moving to the next
   - Maintain focus and completeness

### Architecture Notes
- When developing the Strategy Builder, reference other Tradient repositories for patterns and conventions but make architectural decisions independently based on the specific requirements of this system.
